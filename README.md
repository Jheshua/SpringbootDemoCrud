# SpringbootDemoCrud


This is a project made in Springboot using Java, all  the modules used are in the file pom.
Includes a few simple CRUD and a LOGIN with roles (ADMIN and USER) these roles must be edited on the Database, in this case PhPmyAdmin
The code automatically makes the database however we need atleast to create one (just the name) this is to make the connection

This code is just for testing purposes and learning how to use SpringBoot, nothing professional yet.
